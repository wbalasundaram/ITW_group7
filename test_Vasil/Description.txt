1) I used JUnit to write unit tests which test the following packages:
	* hibernateManagers
	* RESTservices
	* staticResources
	* XMLParse
 During these tests I found 1 unwanted exception being thrown from the XMLParser.unwrapXML() method with specified certain XML input.

2) I used Selenium with JUnint and Firefox driver to produce an automated system test for the login, used to access uclAdmin.jsp. It is in the package SeleniumTests.
